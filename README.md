Tridentu-RK Folder Painter
--------------------------

## What is Folder Painter?

Folder Painter is a Dolphin Service Menu that
allows the user to either change the icon of the folder,
the color of the folder, or both.

## How does it work?

Folder Painter uses Python to operate. In this way, the
folder's appearance can be changed with programming and
ease of understanding in mind.

## How do I install it?

Usually, this comes with Tridentu-RK systems.
However, as long as you have Python 3.10, this service menu
can be used on those systems. Just put the change-folder-color
program in a PATH-aware folder, place the servicemenu in the
usual location for it, and voila! It should work most of the
time, however (there are a few issues with icons).
